## Business Objective 
* The data given contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.

* The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default by understanding how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

* When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:

* Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:
  - Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)
  - Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.
  - Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan 

* Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements
